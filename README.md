> Linking to [this information](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~sankalp/mavscout_system/), this ICRA paper presents the Randomized 
Anytime Orienteering algorithm which is claimed to be a near-optimal solver for a best informative path in an environment. The agorithm leverages random and biased sampling, the TPS problem, and greedy search to make optimal path choices from a set of start, end, and intermediary nodes.
